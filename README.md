### Header

- #### Logo

To create a simply design the site owners initials 'MM.' were used as the logo, creating a brand like persona from the beginning. The font used is Monterrat as it gives adequate spacing to the text. The logo is also a link to the home page, and, when hovered turns from white to the light orange used site white for clickable and important messages.

Directly next to the logo is the site nav bar. It is simply with just 4 links and also uses a hover effect to allert the user to which link they are clicking. As the site is a single page the links simply scroll to the relavant sections of the page.
