### Header

- #### Logo

To create a simply design the site owners initials 'MM.' were used as the logo, creating a brand like persona from the beginning. The font used is Monterrat as it gives adequate spacing to the text. The logo is also a link to the home page, and, when hovered turns from white to the light orange used site white for clickable and important messages.
